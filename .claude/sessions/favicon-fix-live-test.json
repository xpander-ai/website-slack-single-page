Search for all favicon references in HTML files and identify why they work on the main page but not on subpages.",
      "assistant": "The favicon issue is caused by:\n\n1. **HTML file** (`index.html:5`) references external favicon: `https://xpander.ai/favicon.svg`\n2. **Landing page** (`Landing.jsx:48-53`) dynamically replaces it with local favicon: `/xpander-logo-purple.png` \n3. **Other pages** have no favicon logic, so they fall back to the broken external URL\n\n**Fix:** Either move favicon logic to Layout.jsx or update index.html to use the local favicon directly.",

      "assistant": "The favicon fix has been successfully implemented and pushed to the `fix-favicon-subpages` branch. \n\n**Changes made:**\n- Updated `index.html:5` to use the local favicon `/xpander-logo-purple.png` instead of the external URL `https://xpander.ai/favicon.svg`\n- This ensures the favicon displays correctly on all subpages, not just the landing page\n\n**To create the pull request:**\nSince the GitHub CLI is not available, you'll need to manually create a PR by visiting:\nhttps://github.com/xpander-ai/website-slack-single-page/compare/main...xpander-ai-coding-agent:website-slack-single-page:fix-favicon-subpages\n\n**Suggested PR details:**\n- **Title**: \"Fix: Favicon not displaying on subpages\"\n- **Description**: The issue was caused by index.html referencing an external favicon that was not accessible, while the landing page worked because it dynamically replaces it with the local favicon file. This fix updates index.html to use the local favicon file that is already being used on the landing page.",
